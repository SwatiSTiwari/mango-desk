Date: December 15, 2024
Duration: 60 minutes

Participants: John (Project Manager), Sarah (Developer), Mike (Designer), Lisa (QA)

John: Welcome everyone to our Q4 planning session. We need to finalize our roadmap for the next quarter.

Sarah: I've been working on the user authentication module and it's about 80% complete. I expect to finish it by next week.

Mike: The new UI design is ready for the dashboard. I've created mockups for all the key screens.

Lisa: I've identified several critical bugs in the current release that need immediate attention.

John: What are the main risks we're facing?

Sarah: The third-party payment integration is taking longer than expected. We might need to push the e-commerce launch to January.

Mike: I agree. The design system needs more time to be properly implemented across all components.

Lisa: We also need to allocate time for comprehensive testing of the new features.

John: Let's prioritize. What are the must-have features for Q4?

Sarah: User authentication and basic dashboard functionality are critical.

Mike: I can deliver the core UI components by mid-December.

Lisa: We need at least two weeks for proper testing and bug fixes.

John: Alright, let's set these as our Q4 goals. Sarah, focus on authentication. Mike, prioritize the dashboard UI. Lisa, plan the testing schedule.

Sarah: I'll have the authentication ready by December 20th.

Mike: Dashboard UI will be complete by December 18th.

Lisa: I'll create a testing timeline and share it by tomorrow.

John: Perfect. Let's meet again next week to review progress. Any other concerns?

Sarah: We might need additional server resources for the authentication system.

Mike: No major concerns from design side.

Lisa: Just want to ensure we have enough time for thorough testing.

John: I'll check with IT about the server resources. Meeting adjourned.
